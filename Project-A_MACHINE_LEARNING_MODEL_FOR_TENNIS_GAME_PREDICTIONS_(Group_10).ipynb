    "According to a recent study (Pempus, 2015), sports betting is currently a $1.3 Trillion industry globally. In 2014, almost $4 billion was spent on sports betting in Nevada alone and these figures continue to rise. Generally, most seasoned gamblers rely on their deep domain knowledge to place bets. On the other hand, most low-risk gamblers and bettors with limited domain knowledge generally depend on the betting odds of one or a few bookmakers. Nonetheless, betting losses continue to increase in both cases. It is estimated that American gamblers recorded the highest gambling loss ($119 billion) worldwide in 2013 (Aziz, 2014). \n",

    "Tennis is undoubtedly one of the most popular sports in the world. The increase in popularity of the sport, coupled with the expansion of the online sports betting market, has led to a significant rise in the volume of tennis bets recently. The potential profit, as well as academic interest, has fuelled the search for accurate tennis match prediction algorithms(Sipko, 2015). \n",
    "\n",
    "Current prediction algorithms vary in the type of features used in building the model as well as in their prediction methods. Barnett and Clarke (2005) and O’Malley (2008) have developed stochastic tennis prediction models using Markov chains. Both models considered the probability of a player winning individual points or complete sets, based on previous serve statistics of both players. The eventual outcome of a match is then determined by the probability of each player, winning a point during their serve(Sipko, 2015). Knottenbelt (2012) built on this original approach and suggested a model, which only uses both players' performances against common opponents, rather than their average statistics across all opponents. Madurska (2012) later modified Knottenbelt's model to accommodate the changes in player performance from one set to the next.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While several models exist for varied tennis prediction purposes, very few use Machine Learning approaches. Of all the ML models, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are the most widely found in published literature on tennis match predictions. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) have a rating system which ranks all professional tennis players, based on their accummulated points from games. Based on the outcome of a new game and the current ranking / points rating of the two players, the point addition and deduction are determined for the winner and loser respectively. Clarke and Dyte (2009) developed a logistic regression model using this feature. Their model based game outcome predictions on the difference in rating points between the two players. However, their model was limited, since the use of the single feature, rank_difference, implied inherent bias in favor of the higher-ranked player. Ma et al.(2013) also built a logistic regression model based on 16 features comprising player characteristics, performance and match statistics. However, all the models mentioned above, did not provide any specific figures on prediction accuracy. Somboonphokkaphan (2009) presented a 3-layer feed-forward Artificial Neural Network using 27 features which comprised of player and match statistics. Whilst the author reported a 75% prediction accuracy, the model was built using data from only two tournaments (2007 and 2008 Grand Slam). It is therefore difficult to predict the model's performance for the general case or for  other major tournaments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this study is to build a tennis model, that can be generalized over all major tournaments with acceptable prediction accuracy.   "

    "The Logistic Regression is employed to binary classify the explanatory variable representing the winning result. Further, 10 fold cross validation method is used to validate the generated model on the test data. The winning prediction varies every time the model is trained and evaluated as the training and test data are selected on random basis each time for 10 fold. Roughly, the accuracy of the model is observed to hover around the range 60%-65%. The step size (alpha) defines the performance of a model. Below are the results obtained with alpha=0.001. The accuracy is less than 58% in this case."

    "As can be deduced from the above set of results, the 10-fold cross validation performance is impacted primarily by the two components (3rd and 8th) of the 10-fold system, which tilted the scales from the average error otherwise tending to be less than 40 to -what it ended up to be- 42. Arguably, the training data must have been badly scattered in these two cases that the learning must have been bad resulting in bad fit and hence the bad validation results.\n",
    "Moving on, however, running the model over a range of alpha values can help us decide on the alpha value that consistently delivers best results. The below attached graph (Fig 1) is one such attempt where the error rate is plotted against its corresponding alpha value. The best performance is observed at alpha value of 0.001. The model takes about 2 hours for a single run. And so due to this computational expense as well as the limited high computing resources at our disposal, we were unable to try more alpha values for better parameter tuning. However, in future we intend to experiment more alpha values to arrive at the best accuracy possible.\n"

    "In this project, we explored the ability of Machine Learning techniques to predict the outcome of tennis games. Unlike previous tennis models, our model incorporates all the following features along with others: the betting odds from four major bookmakers, player point difference and player rank difference. In all, our model had 22 features. The Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine(linear kernel), Support Vector Machine(polynomial kernel), RBF Kernel SVM, K-Nearest Neighbor and the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifiers were tested using the train data. The best model was obtained with Logistic Regression, which gave 64% cross-validation accuracy and 60% accuracy on the test data. By comparison with previous tennis models, it can be concluded that our model performs fairly well and gives predictions which are in the ballpark of current good tennis models. For the RBF Kernel SVM, better results may have been obtained by tuning gamma and C. This will be explored in future works. Also, future works will focuss on engineering more features and training the data on other ML classifier models such as DecisionTrees, Gradient Boosting methods, Neural Networks and Random Forest in an attempt to obtain better predictive performance.
